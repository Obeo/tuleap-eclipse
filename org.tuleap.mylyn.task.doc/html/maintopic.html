	<h1>Mylyn Connector for Tuleap - User Documentation</h1>
	<h2>Install the connector</h2>
	<p>In order to install the connector, you can use the Eclipse
		Marketplace available from the "Help -> Eclipse Marketplace" menu. In
		the marketplace, you just have to search for Tuleap in order to find
		the latest version of the connector available.</p>

	<h2>Connect to a Tuleap server</h2>
	<p>To establish a connection with a Tuleap server, you need to go
		in the Task Repositories or Team Repositories view in order to create
		a new Mylyn repository. Select the Task connector "Tuleap Repository
		Connector" and click next.</p>
	<img src="../images/create_repository.png" />
	<p>In the next page of the wizard, you have access to the page used
		to connect to the Tuleap server. Use the URL of the trackers of your
		Tuleap project along with your Tuleap username and password to connect
		to the Tuleap server as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
	<img src="../images/repository_settings.png" />
	<p>Your login and password will be valited prior to the connection
		but you can force the verification to ensure that your credentials are
		valid. Do not forget to make sure that the connector will remember
		your password by checking the associated checkbox.</p>

	<h2>Create a query</h2>
	<p>Once you have created your repository, Mylyn Task will ask you
		to create a query in order to retrieve your tasks from the Tuleap
		server. You can use the new Query wizard in order to create your
		query. First you will have to select the project for which you want to
		create the query.</p>
	<img src="../images/create_query_select_project.png" />
	<p>Once your project is selected, you have to select the type of
		query to perform. In fact, there are three types of queries. The first
		one uses reports relying on a specific tracker of the selected
		project. To create a such query, you can select the first alternative
		and give a name to your query. Then you can select the concerned
		tracker and validate your choice.</p>
	<img src="../images/create_query_select_tracker.png" />
	<p>The second type relies on a specific set of criteria, in order
		to filter the results according to these criteria. There is one
		criterion per field, and each criterion entered is used to filter the
		results returned. Just leave a criterion empty (as it is by default)
		if you don't want to use it to filter the results. A query is somewhat
		like a Tuleap report, except the criteria are stored in your eclipse,
		not on the Tuleap server. So, such a query cannot be shared with other
		users.</p>
	<img src="../images/custom_query.png" />
	<p>The third type of query is used to access the Top-level
		planning. The top-level planning allows you to plan top-level backlog
		items in top-level milestones. For instance, if you use Sprints in
		Releases, you'll be able to plan which backlog items should go into
		which release. To do so, you can select the relevant project, select
		the third alternative and validate your query.</p>
	<img src="../images/top_planning_query.png" />
	<p>When your query has been executed by Mylyn Task, its result will
		be available in the Task List view. In this view, you can see the list
		of the tasks matching your query along with the completion of the
		query.</p>

	<h2>Display and edit tasks</h2>
	<p>If you want to display a specific task, you just have to double
		click on it from the Task List view.</p>
	<img src="../images/task_editor.png" />

	<h2>Update a task</h2>
	<p>Once modified, you can update the task on the Tuleap server by
		using the "Submit" button on top of the editor.</p>

	<h2>Add attachments</h2>
	<p>If the configuration of your Tuleap tracker allows it, you can
		add attachments to your task directly from the Tuleap task editor.</p>
	<img src="../images/attachments.png" />
	<p>You can also use the screenshot tooling to directly attach a
		screenshot with various annotations.</p>
	<img src="../images/screenshot_attachment_editor.png" />

	<h2>Link with the context</h2>
	<p>Mylyn Task will let you activate a specific task thanks to the
		round button in the Task List view and at the top of the task editor.
		Once a task has been activated, all manipulated elements will be
		linked with the active task. You can see those linked element in the
		context tab of the task editor. When you are done working on a
		specific task, you just need to uncheck the activate task button. The
		task and its context will then be closed.</p>
	<img src="../images/context.png" />
	<p>You can easily retrieve the context of a task by re-activating
		it. All the elements of the context that you had used will be
		reopened.</p>
	<p>You can easily attach the context of a task as an attachment and
		submit it on the Tuleap server. You can retrieve the context from an
		attachment too.</p>
	<h2>Display a task planning</h2>
	<p>If you want to display a task planning, you just have to open
		the task and go under the "Planning" tab.</p>
	<p>In the case of a "top planning", the releases are sorted by date
		descending on the right and the backlog is displayed on the left.</p>
	<img src="../images/display_task_planning.png" />
	<p>In the case of a "release planning", the release's sprints are
		sorted by date descending on the right and the backlog is displayed on
		the left.</p>
	<p>In the case of a "sprint planning", the sprints's sub-milestones
		are sorted by date descending on the right, the backlog is displayed
		on the bottom left and the burn-down chart on the up left. When there
		are no sub-milestones, the backlog is displayed on the right, and the
		burn-down chart is displayed on the left. If there is no burn-down
		chart, then the backlog occupy the whole planning tab.</p>
	<h2>Organize planning artifacts</h2>
	<p>If you want to organize artifacts belonging to backlog, releases
		or sprints, you can select one or many ones and then drag and drop
		them on target.</p>
	<img src="../images/organize_planning_artifacts.png" />
	<h2>Expand and collapse milestones</h2>
	<p>You have the possibility to expand and collapse milestones one
		by one, or all at once.</p>
	<p>- To expand a milestone, click on the small triangle that is
		pointing right on the left of milestone's name.</p>
	<p>- To collapse a milestone, click on the small triangle that is
		pointing down on the left of milestone's name.</p>
	<p>- To expand all milestones at once, click on the "plus" icon on
		the top right of milestones section.</p>
	<p>- To collapse all milestones at once, click on the "minus" icon
		on the top right of milestones section.</p>
	<img src="../images/expand_collapse_planning.png" />
	<h2>Create a new artifact in a milestone's backlog</h2>
	<p>You have the possibility to create an artifact directly from the
		planning editor. To do so, click on the "plus" icon on the top right
		of the backlog. Then the list of available trackers will be displayed.
		Choose the tracker and validate your choice.</p>
	<img src="../images/create_new_planning_artifact.png" />
	<h2>Display a task card wall</h2>
	<p>If you want to display a task card wall, you just have to open
		the task and go under the "Card Wall" tab.</p>
	<p>Every card displays its type and its identifier as a link. When
		clicking on this link, the task is opened.</p>
	<img src="../images/display_cardwall.png" />
	<h2>Direct edition on cards</h2>
	<p>You have the possibility to direct edit the card details. To do
		so, you can click a first time on the field value in order to select
		it and then a second time in order to enter the edit mode for this
		field.</p>
	<img src="../images/direct_edit_cards.png" />
	<h2>Organize cards on card wall</h2>
	<p>Cards could be organized with drag-and-drop to indicate their
		states. If the target column belongs to the cards' authorized columns,
		the moved card is displayed on this column. If the target column does
		not belong to the cards' authorized columns, a banning sign is
		displayed.</p>
	<img src="../images/organize_cards.png" />
