	<h2>Install the connector</h2>
	<p>
		In order to install the connector, you can use the Eclipse Marketplace available from the
		"Help -> Eclipse Marketplace" menu. In the marketplace, you just have to search for Tuleap
		in order to find the latest version of the connector available.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Connect to a Tuleap server</h2>
	<p>
		To establish a connection with a Tuleap server, you need to go in the Task Repositories or Team
		Repositories view in order to create a new Mylyn repository. Select the Task connector "Tuleap
		Repository Connector" and click next.

	<p>
		In the next page of the wizard, you have access to the page used to connect to the Tuleap server.
		Use the URL of the trackers of your Tuleap project along with your Tuleap username and password to
		connect to the Tuleap server as shown in the following screenshot.
	</p>

	<p>
		Your login and password will be valited prior to the connection but you can force the verification
		to ensure that your credentials are valid. Do not forget to make sure that the connector will
		remember your password by checking the associated checkbox.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Create a query</h2>
	<p>
		Once you have created your repository, Mylyn Task will ask you to create a query in order to retrieve
		your tasks from the Tuleap server. You can use the new Query wizard in order to create your query. First
		you will have to select the project for which you want to create the query.
	</p>
	<img src="../images/create_query_select_project.png" />
	<p>
	    Once your project is selected, you will see the list of all the trackers of the selected project.
	</p>
	<img src="../images/create_query_select_tracker.png" />
	<p>
		In this wizard, you can create two kinds of queries: locally created ones or queries saved on the server.
		In your Tuleap project, you may have created reports in order to vizualize a specific set of tasks matching
		a set of critera, you can execute those reports directly from the Mylyn Connector for Tuleap. you can
		also define new queries directly in Eclipse.
	</p>
	<img src="../images/create_query_reports.png" />
	<p>
	    You can access your reports from the third page of the wizard or you can continue to the fourth page to create
	    a custom query.
	</p>
	<img src="../images/custom_query.png" />
	<p>
		When your query has been executed by Mylyn Task, its result will be available in the Task List view.
		In this view, you can see the list of the tasks matching your query along with the completion of the query.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Display and edit tasks</h2>
	<p>
		If you want to display a specific task, you just have to double click on it from the Task List view.
	</p>
	<img src="../images/task_editor.png" />
		
	<h2>Update a task</h2>
	<p>
		Once modified, you can update the task on the Tuleap server by using the "Submit" button on top of the
		editor.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Add attachments</h2>
	<p>
		If the configuration of your Tuleap tracker allows it, you can add attachments to your task directly
		from the Tuleap task editor.
	</p>
	<img src="../images/attachments.png" />
	<p>

	</p>
	<img src="../images/screenshot_attachment_editor.png" />
	
	<h2>Link with the context</h2>
	<p>
		Mylyn Task will let you activate a specific task thanks to the round button in the Task List view and
		at the top of the task editor. Once a task has been activated, all manipulated elements will be linked
		with the active task. You can see those linked element in the context tab of the task editor. When you
		are done working on a specific task, you just need to uncheck the activate task button. The task and its
		context will then be closed.
	</p>
	<img src="../images/context.png" />
	<p>
		You can easily retrieve the context of a task by re-activating it. All the elements of the context that
		you had used will be reopened. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You can easily attach the context of a task as an attachment and submit it on the Tuleap server. You
		can retrieve the context from an attachment too.
