After a new regeneration of the SOAP API, search for the following regex in all the Java files with warnings:

(\;)([\r\n\s]+[\r\n\s]+public class)

And replace the content matched by the following content:

\;\r\n\r\n@SuppressWarnings("all")\r\npublic class

It will change this:

.....";

public class".....


To this:

.....";

@SuppressWarning("all")
public class".....
